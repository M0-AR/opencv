# Contributing to OpenCV Toolkit

We love your input! We want to make contributing to OpenCV Toolkit as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use snake_case for Python files and functions
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Add type hints to all functions
- Include docstrings for all modules and functions
- Keep functions focused and small

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Place tests in the appropriate test directory
- Follow test naming convention: test_[feature]_[scenario]

## Documentation

- Update README.md with any needed changes
- Update API documentation if you change interfaces
- Add comments and docstrings for complex logic
- Include examples for new features
